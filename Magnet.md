# Introduction #

Magnet is a tool that spares writing platform-specific Java application startup files (.sh, .bat, ...) by supporting a neutral XML format describing application runtime parameters and bootstrap configuration. To top it off, Magnet also supports launching multiple standalone Java applications in the same JVM, each with its own classloader that operates in isolation from the others. Magnet's goal is to provide for the run-time what Ant provides for the build time.
