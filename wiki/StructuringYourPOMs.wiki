Describes how POM hierarchy works in Sapia projects

= How-To =

Whenever a project is created in the Sapia repository, a POM must be set up. In order to avoid repeating redundant configuration elements through each POM, we've decided to benefit from Maven's support for so-called "POM hierarchies".

It goes like this: we've defined a global parent POM, which is kept in the repository, and released whenever me modify it. That POM defines elements such as: 

  * Project developers
  * Documentation plugin configuration 
  * etc.  

In order to inherit from the global POM, just declare a 'parent' element, as in the following snippet:

{{{
  <parent>
    <groupId>org.sapia</groupId>
    <artifactId>sapia_global</artifactId>
    <version>1.0</version>
  </parent>
}}}

Use the most current version of the global POM. Then, you only need specifying the essentials as part of your project POM:

  * name, description, artifact ID, group ID, version
  * packaging
  * license (if different than Apache 2.0)
  * dependencies
  *
