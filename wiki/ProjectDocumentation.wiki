= How-To =

== Overview ==

All Sapia doc is authored using XML, based on elements that combine XHTML with custom Sapia tags. The documentation files are saved with the xdocs.xml extension (e.g.: home.xdocs.xml), and process as part of Maven's 'site' phase. Sapia's custom documentation plugin (a Maven plugin), processes these xdocs files as part of project builds.

The plugin is configured in Sapia's global POM, from which all Sapia projects by convention inherit.  

== Documentation Layout ==

The xdocs files must be kept under a project structure identical to this one:
{{{
<project_home>/
           sapia/
                site/
                    xml/
}}}
Then, as part of documentation generation, the standard Maven site is also generated according to the [http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-site-plugin/examples/creating-content.html  Maven conventions].


== Output ==

The xdocs files are tranformed with XSL, and the output is saved under `target/site`. For its part, the Maven site is generated under `target/site/maven`.

It is thus up to the content of the xdocs files to point to the maven site accordingly.
