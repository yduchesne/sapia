= Introduction =

Typically, you'll "interact" with Sapia projects to:

  # Depend on releases of specific libraries
  # Build from source 
  # Publish new releases (this requires developer access)

1) and 2) are the typical use cases (they only require read access to the Maven repository where the Sapia libs are published).

3) Is a bit more involving: it requires an account at Java.net.

*Note*: You can find more details [https://maven2-repository.dev.java.net/ on Java.net]

= 1) and 2) Using Maven to acquire dependencies =

If you want to include Sapia libraries as dependencies in your projects, you must configure the Java.net Maven 2 repository - either in your projects' POM, or in your `settings.xml` file:

{{{
<repository>
  <id>maven2-repository.dev.java.net</id>
  <name>Java.net Repository for Maven</name>
  <url>http://download.java.net/maven/2/</url>
  <layout>default</layout>
</repository>
}}}

If you are building the Sapia projects from source, these already include the above information in their POM, so you may just check out and do a `mvn install`.

= 3) Publishing releases =

To publish releases, you'll need the following:

  # An account at Java.net, in order to upload the releases to their Maven 2 repository.
  # An account at Google code, and write-access to the Sapia projects (meaning you need to be a committer).

More concretely:

== Configure the Google Code Credentials ==

In your `settings.xml` file, add the following within the `servers` element:

{{{
  <server>
	<id>sapia.googlecode.com</id>
	<username>johnsmith</username>
	<password>hhje7298ska</password>
  </server>
}}}

== Configure the Java.net Credentials ==

The Java.net wagon expects your credentials to be present in this file: `~/.java.net` - i.e.: note that the file is under your home directory. The content should be as follows:

{{{
userName=jsmith
password=mysecretpass
}}}
