= Introduction =

Typically, you'll "interact" with Sapia projects to:

  # Depend on releases of specific libraries
  # Build from source 
  # Publish new releases (this requires developer access)

1) and 2) are the typical use cases (they only require read access to the Maven repository where the Sapia libs are published).

3) Is a bit more involving: it requires an account at Java.net.

= 1) and 2) Using Maven to acquire dependencies =

If you want to include Sapia libraries as dependencies in your projects, you must configure the Java.net Maven 2 repository:

{{{
<repository>
  <id>java.net</id>
  <url>http://download.java.net/maven/1</url>
  <layout>legacy</layout>
</repository>
}}}
