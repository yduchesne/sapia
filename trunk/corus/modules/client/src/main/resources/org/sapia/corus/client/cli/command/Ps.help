  <section title="Syntax">
    <p>ps [-d distribution_name][-v version][-n process_name][-p profile][-ports][-cluster]</p>
    <p/>
    <p>OR</p>
    <p/>
    <p>ps [-i process_identifier][-ports]</p>
    <p/>
    <p>Where:</p>
    <p/>
    <p>- d: the name (or name pattern) of the distribution for which to display running processes.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>- v: the version (or version pattern) of the distribution for which to display running processes.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>- p: the profile for which to display the process(es).</p>
    <p/>
    <p>- n: the name (or name pattern) of the process configurations for which processes should be displayed.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>- i: the Corus-specific identifier of the process to display.</p>
    <p/>    
    <p>- ports: indicates that the ports used by the processes should be displayed.</p>
    <p/>    
    <p>- cluster: specifies if the command should be executed cluster-wide.</p>    
  </section>
  <section title="Notes">
    <p>- The -n option corresponds to the "name" attribute of the "process" element in a corus.xml configuration.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>- When used with the -i option, this operation will not be clustered - and will thus exclusively be performed on the Corus server to which the client console is connected.</p>
