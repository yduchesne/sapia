NEW FEATURES
============

1) Pattern Matching

Certain command-line arguments can be specified as patterns, in order to improve 
user experience and productivity.

The man pages have been updated, as well as the user guide (examples are provided).

BUG FIXES AND IMPROVEMENTS
==========================

1) Process Startup Interval

When starting multiple processes simultaneously, the CPU could be bottlenecked.
Now, when starting processes following an 'exec' by end-users, Corus waits for 
a specified amount of time between each startup. 

A corresponding configuration property has been added to the corus.properties 
file: corus.process.start-interval. This property specifies the interval (in 
seconds) between each process startup, following a user command. The value
of this property defaults to 15.

INSTALLATION
============

- Download Corus 1.2 package from 
  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=68099&package_id=167207.
- Untar corus package in new install directory.

- If not upgrading from existing installation:
  - Follow installation notes in Corus Guide.
  
- If upgrading from existing installation:  
  - Terminate currently running Corus processes (through Corus CLI).
  - Shut down Corus server (/etc/init.d/corus stop).
  - Copy files from $OLD_CORUS_HOME/config (corus_process.properties,  
    corus.properties,  corus_service.properties, logkit.conf) 
    to $NEW_CORUS_HOME/config, so that the configuration is unaltered.
  - Add corus.process.start-interval property to corus.properties file. 

- Start new Corus instance.

DEVELOPER NOTES
===============

Client applications the must be updated with the sapia_corus-1.2a.jar library.

WARNING
=======

Corus will start up with a fresh datastore. All distributions in the 
old install will not be available. New deployments should be made in this case.
