      <p>
        Sapia aims at providing quality open-source software to the developer community.
        We are adepts of lightweight and agile; we strive for modularity, reusability, 
        elegance. We also think that good documentation is a must, and go to great lengths 
        to make sure that all projects we publish are thoroughly documented.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through the years, we ourselves, as developers of solutions, have benefited from
        open source software. Sapia is a modest attempt at giving back.
