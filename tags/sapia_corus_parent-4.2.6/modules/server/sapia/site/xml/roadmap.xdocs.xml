      <p>
        We define our roadmap based on what we think is important, but 
        community input is given the utmost priority. Your comments are welcome. 
        Send them to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the meantime, here's what's on our plate(in no specific order):

    <sapia:sect2 title="Explicit Multi-Language Support">
      <p>
        Deployment of JVM-based applications in other languages than Java
        is somewhat already supported, but we'd rather it be more explicit. 
        It is our priority to make possible deployment in and execution of 
        processes in the following languages: Scala, Jython, Clojure, JRuby.
      </p>
    </sapia:sect2>
    <sapia:sect2 title="Cloud Deployment">
      <p>
        Corus as it is now can be deployed in the Cloud. But we're aiming at a tighter
        integration with Cloud infrastructure (namely AWS), in order to make Corus
        cloud deployment a breeze.
      </p>
    </sapia:sect2>
    <sapia:sect2 title="Enterprise-grade management console">
      <p>
        Currently, the only way to administer application processes controlled 
        by Corus is to use the Corus CLI (command-line interface). We plan on 
        offering a robust management console that will allow managing Corus 
        domains (whether cloud-based or not) from a single web-based user 
        interface.
